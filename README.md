# Fizz Buzz with TDD

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
* For multiples of **three** print _Fizz_ instead of the number 
* For multiples of **five** print _Buzz_  instead of the number 
* For numbers which are multiples of **both** three and five print _FizzBuzz_

Use TDD and whatever language you want.

Happy coding!
