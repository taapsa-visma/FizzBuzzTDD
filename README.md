# Fizz Buzz with TDD

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
* For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number 
* For multiples of five print “Buzz”  instead of the number 
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz “

Use TDD and whatever language you want.

Happy coding!
